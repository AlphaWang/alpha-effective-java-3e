# Item 12: Always override toString

*    Providing a good toString implementation makes your class much more pleasant to use and makes systems using the class easier to debug.
*    {Jenny=PhoneNumber@163b91} or {Jenny=707-867-5309}, what is good?
*    When practical, the toString method should return all of the interesting information contained in the object, 
*    Whether or not you decide to specify the format, you should clearly document your intentions. 
*    Provide programmatic access to the information contained in the value returned by toString.
